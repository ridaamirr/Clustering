# Clustering Algorithms Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, K-Means++, K-Medoids, and K-Medians, using synthetic data. The results are visualized using Matplotlib.

## Overview

The following clustering algorithms are implemented in this project:
- K-Means
- K-Means++
- K-Medoids
- K-Medians

The synthetic dataset is generated using `make_blobs` from `sklearn.datasets`, and the features are scaled using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.
